			TO DO

Before you try to modify this code, read hacking.asc.

* Progress reporting within files for large files with many commits?

* The QED repo in the tests directory raises a branch cycle error.
  This may reveal a bug in the second toposort function. 

* The twicedead repo in the tests directory misbehaves under cvsconvert.

* Issue a warning when the same tag is attached to multiple commits.
  At the moment it's just silently reported attached to the last.
