The file twicedead began in state Exp in 1.1, was set to state dead in 1.2, 
Exp in 1.3, and dead in 1.4.  This produced odd behavior, as
shown by cvscompare:

twicedead test of branch master: trees matched as expected
twicedead test of tag badtag: file manifests don't match.
twicedead test of tag badtag: common: 1
twicedead test of tag badtag: gitspace only: set(['twicedead'])
twicedead test of tag goodtag: trees matched as expected

These two files were extracted from the timidity CVS repository
and stripped to the smallest possible test case.

This turns out to be a bug in CVS!

badtag goes with revision 1.17 of longlived, which is dated
2004-02-13T15:57:33 *before* twicedead was set to state dead in its
1.4 revision on 2004-10-27T12:21:52.  Thus, twicedead should in fact
be visible at the history state corresponding to the tag.
